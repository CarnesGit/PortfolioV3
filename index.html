            <p class="aboutP">
                I was born in Boston, MA in 1980. I grew up in a small town called Bridgewater, MA and lived there until 2001 when I joined the U.S. Army as a Paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. In 2006, after completing 3 combat tours, and almost 5 years of service,
                I received an honorable discharge at the rank of Sergeant, and moved to Coral Springs, FL.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutP">
                I started working for a security company, and worked my way up from a Security Officer to the Operations Director in two short years. I held the ranks of "Officer ", "Post Captain ", "Major ", "Field Training Officer ", and "Chief Field Training Officer
                " before obtaining the Director postion. I worked there from 2006 until 2010 when my wife and I moved to where her family was located in Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutP">
                Two years after that I started working at the University of Pennsylvania as a Gardener. I have worked at UPenn now for 7 years and that is where I learned of a course offered called "UPenn Coding Bootcamp ". I am now enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp to
                explore my lifelong passion with computers by learning to code software.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutP">It is my goal to obtain a career that I will love instead of just working for the money. This is a career path that I am very excited to explore.
